This repository contains some of the code and data used in my thesis, "Exploring Danish court rulings using quantitative methods: The evolution of the Danish legal language and prediction of who is to pay the cost of a trial".

Most of the code cannot run since the original dataset is proprietary. It is published for the examinators to review my methods if they desire. I apologise for the generally messy code; I did not have time to properly clean and organise the code.

The embeddings are however very useable! The embeddings are published as keyedvectors, which can be imported using the `Gensim'-library.
