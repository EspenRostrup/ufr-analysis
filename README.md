This repository contains some of the code and data used in my thesis "Exploring Danish court rulings using quantitative methods: The evolution of the Danish legal language and prediction of who is to pay the cost of a trial".

Most of the code cannot run since the original dataset is proprietary. It is published for the examinators to review my methods if they so desire. I appologies for the generally messy code; I did not have time to do a proper cleaning and organisation of the code.
